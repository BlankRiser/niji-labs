					Welcome to the <span className="font-bold mr-1"> Niji component library!</span>
					"Niji," meaning "Rainbow" in Japanese, symbolizes the vibrant and diverse range
					of UI components that this system offers.
				</p>
				<p>
				</p>
				<p>
					This design system leverages a combination of CSS libraries and accessibility
					tools to create inclusive and beautiful user interfaces. 
					I wanted a library like Shadcn for myself but using various libraries like ark-ui, ariakit...etc.
          Just as a rainbow
					encompasses a spectrum of colors, Niji integrates multiple tools and libraries
					to cover a broad range of design and accessibility needs.
				</p>

					Explore the Niji component library and start building your next accessible and
					visually appealing project today!
